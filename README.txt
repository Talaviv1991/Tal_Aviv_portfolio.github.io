The project workflow is built around four stages.

* Stage 1 focuses on collecting and cleaning raw data using Power Query. 
* Stage 2 builds a structured data model for analysis.
* Stage 3 uses DAX expressions to create custom calculations for deeper insights.
* Stage 4 turns data into clear and interactive reports and dashboards.
